# Mass-Sentiment-Analyzer
A twitter based sentiment analyzer. 

A very simple hobby project as a start into the field of machine learning/data science. 

The Analyzer connects to a Twitter app, reads tweets through Tweepy related to 'Pakistan' and then does simple sentiment analysis on them via Python's TextBlob Natural Language Processing library.
